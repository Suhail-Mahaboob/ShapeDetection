# 🖼️ Image Detection Projects  

A collection of small projects using **Python + OpenCV** to learn and practice computer vision.  
Each project is inside its own folder with code, requirements, and a README.  

---

## 📌 Projects  

1. [ShapeDetection](./ShapeDetection)  
   - Detects shapes (Triangle, Square, Rectangle, Circle) from an input image.  
   - Uses contours, polygon approximation, and bounding boxes.  

2. [ColorDetectionLive](./ColorDetectionLive)  
   - Real-time detection of red objects from webcam feed.  
   - Uses HSV color space + contour detection.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

Clone this repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suhail-Mahaboob/ShapeDetection.git
cd ImageDetectionProjects
```
Then go inside any project folder, install dependencies, and run the script. 

Example:
```bash
cd ShapeDetection
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ShapeDetection.py
```
🎯 Goal
This repo is my learning path into Computer Vision & AI, starting small with OpenCV and gradually moving towards deep learning (YOLO, Plant Disease Detection, Drone Vision).
